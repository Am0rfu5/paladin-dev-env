# Roadmap: Paladin

## Overview

**Paladin already works.** It ships at v0.7.0 with a Cargo workspace of ten library crates plus a
`doc-examples` crate and the root `paladin-ai` facade, 22 runnable examples, an HTTP API with
OpenAPI and SSE streaming, a `paladin-server` binary, a 112 MB multi-arch Docker image and
reference Kubernetes manifests. (**Amended by Phase 4, dated 2026-08-03, citing
`04-release-measurement.md`**: the "22 runnable examples" figure traces to a Milestone 1 Epic 10
validation report ("22/22 examples compiling") and has since gone stale — the shipped tree carries
**47** `.rs` files under `examples/`, of which four are declared `[[example]]` targets gating on
non-default features (`vision`, `content-processing`, `web-server`); no crate under `crates/` ships
its own `examples/` directory. The shipped tree outranks an ingested count under this project's
precedence order. Going forward the gate REL-05 and ROADMAP criterion 5 express is "every example
target builds", not a count, so this figure cannot go stale the same way again.)

**This planning corpus is a historical record of twelve shipped milestones plus a verified-defect
and deferred-work forward scope. It is not a greenfield plan.** Across the 263 documents in
`.project/`, 7,511 of 8,053 task items are checked (93%) — and five runs of direct code
verification found the shipped tree *ahead of* even that figure in most places. **This roadmap does
not build the framework. It closes out milestones that already shipped, fixes what verification
proved broken, and builds the one epic-set nobody ever started.**

The sixteen phases fall into four kinds of work, and it is worth naming them before the detail:

| Kind | Phases | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Record** | 1, 5, 7, 10, 13 | Make `.planning/` describe the code as it actually is, so nobody re-plans shipped work or applies a superseded PRD literally |
| **Verified defect** | 8, 12 | Fix the things direct verification proved broken — a permanently red CI job, missing annotations, disabled doctests, leaked dependencies, a duplicated audit job |
| **Decision** | 9, 11, 14 | Answer the questions the corpus left open, including the ones with a correctness or security consequence attached |
| **Genuinely unbuilt** | 2, 3, 4, 6, 15, 16 | The residual functional gaps, the quality gates, and the two deferred registers whose work was never started |

### The milestone arc this roadmap closes out

**M1-M3 built capability.** Paladin, Garrison, Arsenal, the four base Battalion patterns, Herald,
Citadel, Commander and the Armory CLI (M1); then Sanctum vector memory and RAG, Sentinel vision,
autonomous agents, Conclave, Council, Grove and the Maneuver Flow DSL (M2); then the completion
pass over all of it (M3).

**M4-M8 dismantled and rebuilt the structure that capability lived in**, at considerable cost and
with almost no feature work: feature-flag expansion and port hardening (M4), the monolith becoming
a Cargo workspace (M5), four layer relocations (M6), four more crate extractions and the first
crates.io publish (M7), and a facade cleanup that a dated reconciliation then audited against the
tree and took further than its own plan allowed (M8).

**M9-M12 finished, hardened, documented and exposed it.** M9 completed the half of the platform
M4-M8 had left alone — a real `execute_workflow()`, a workflow repository with crash recovery,
scheduler/queue/event validation, the bidirectional content-agent bridge and user/admin RBAC. M10
made it releasable: pre-commit, cargo-audit + cargo-deny + OSV-Scanner, a CycloneDX SBOM,
cargo-release with dependency-ordered publishing, and — after an incident — main-only tag
enforcement. M11 documented it into an mdbook with 227 broken links repaired and linkcheck as an
error. M12 exposed it over HTTP, **and it exists because M11's documentation epic wrote down a
capability gap instead of papering over it.**

### What the phases do, in order

**Milestone 1 close-out (Phases 1-4)** is short and specific. Make the planning record match the
shipped code and give each of the six contested type/gate definitions one recorded answer
(Phase 1). Close the residual functional gaps verification exposes and apply those definitions in
code (Phase 2). Make the quality numbers real rather than aspirational (Phase 3). Make the release
coherent — one version, one edition, a defensible advisory posture, reviewed docs, the whole gate
suite green (Phase 4).

**Milestone 2-3 close-out (Phases 5-6)** is shorter still, and that is the finding rather than an
omission. Sanctum, RAG, Sentinel vision, autonomous planning and handoffs, Conclave, Council,
Grove, the Maneuver Flow DSL, the enhanced CLI, Herald consolidation, the Paladin registry and the
scheduler port **all ship in the v0.7.0 tree.** What is missing is the record (Phase 5). Exactly one
defect in run-2 scope is verified open, and it closes alongside whatever Phase 5 exposes (Phase 6).

**Milestone 4-6 close-out (Phases 7-8)** covers the three milestones that restructured what M1-M3
built. All of it shipped, and unusually for this corpus it was verified directly against
`Cargo.toml` contents and type definitions rather than inferred. Phase 7 records what shipped and
answers the variant pairs; **Phase 8 is the first phase whose scope is entirely verified defects.**

**Milestone 7-8 close-out (Phases 9-11)** is the first block where the *record* is in better shape
than the gates. The 2026-06-04 reconciliation is the most reliable document in the corpus — every
verifiable claim in it matches the tree, including a `println!` residue count exact to the
occurrence. So Phase 9 fixes the gates rather than the record and **carries the only dated item in
the corpus, a RustSec acceptance expiring 2026-09-30**. Phase 10 writes down what M7-M8 delivered.
Phase 11 disposes of the deferred registers.

**Milestone 9-12 + Deferred-QA close-out (Phases 12-16)** is where the last of the forward work
lives, and it splits cleanly. Phase 12 deletes eighteen lines of CI that falsify a completed
milestone's own success metric, and gives thirteen advisory suppressions an owner and a date.
Phase 13 records what four milestones delivered and answers two seams M12 left as defaults.
Phase 14 closes the gap between what the project's interfaces *advertise* and what they *do* — an
API documented as JWT and implemented as opaque tokens, a Kubernetes Deployment against an
in-process token store, and an LLM capability flag that over-reports. Phase 15 builds the quality
gates Deferred-QA Epic 25 specified and nobody started, then closes the coverage register those
gates measure. Phase 16 finishes Milestone 11's documentation currency — **the only open checkbox
count in all 542 that survives verification** — and decides the fate of an architecture document
frozen at 311 lines that two milestones made invisible.

| **Milestone 2-3 close-out** | 5-6 | ✅ **Shipped v0.8.0 (2026-08-24)** — [archive](milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md) | Ingest run 2 — `.project/Milestone_2-Missing_features` + `.project/Milestone_3-Completion` (45 docs) |

| **Milestone 9-12 + Deferred-QA close-out** | 12-16 | ✅ **Shipped v0.8.0 (2026-08-24)** — [archive](milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md) | Ingest run 5 (FINAL) — `.project/Milestone_9-Classic-Orchestrator-Completion` + `.project/Milestone_10-CI-Hardening-Release-Automation` + `.project/Milestone_11-Documentation-Overhaul-Publish` + `.project/Milestone_12-Web-API` + `.project/Deferred-QA-CICD-Completion` + `.project/project-management` (46 docs) |
| **Provider Expansion** | 17 | ✅ **Shipped v0.8.0 (2026-08-24)** — [archive](milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md) | Forward work — not ingest-derived. Added 2026-08-15 per *Roadmap Extension Protocol* item 1. |
| **Security Tooling** | 18- | ◆ **Current — v0.9.0, started 2026-08-24** | Forward work — not ingest-derived. Added 2026-08-24 per *Roadmap Extension Protocol* item 1, closing the Rust-SAST gap the v0.8.0 milestone audit left as its one genuinely open item. |

**The ingest is complete.** All 263 documents in `.project/` are covered — 199 classified across
five runs and 64 `tasks-*.md` measured deterministically by `intel/task-completion-state.md`. There
is no run 6. The *Roadmap Extension Protocol* at the end of this file still governs any future
addition, but nothing is pending.

Milestone numbering follows the **directory / task-list numbering**. Four source milestones number
themselves differently — the M4-M6 overviews use refactoring tiers ("Milestone 1/2/3"), the M3
release notes assign Epics 19-23 to four M2 features, and the M7 overview titles itself
"Milestone 4" — and none of those labels is used as a key anywhere in this file (VERIFY-03,
ARCH-02, HARD-04). **The protocol predicted a fifth instance in run 5; run 5 found none, and
ORCH-05 records the prediction closed.**

- [ ] **Phase 18: Rust SAST — Evaluate and Adopt CodeQL** - Prove a Rust-capable SAST actually analyses this tree before adopting it, then wire it as a non-blocking scan and only afterwards as a required check

## Phase Details

*Phases 1-4 are archived in [`milestones/v0.7.1-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.7.1-ROADMAP.md).
Phases 5-17 — every phase of the v0.8.0 milestone, with their full goals, success criteria,
amendment banners and per-plan checklists — are archived in
[`milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v0.8.0-ROADMAP.md), together with
[`v0.8.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`](milestones/v0.8.0-REQUIREMENTS.md) and
[`v0.8.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`](milestones/v0.8.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md). Only phases in the current
and future milestones are detailed below, which is what keeps this file a constant size per
milestone.*

### Phase 18: Rust SAST — Evaluate and Adopt CodeQL

**Goal**: This project stops having to say "there is no static taint analysis for first-party Rust" — either because a scanner is running that provably finds real defects in *this* tree, or because the evaluation proved it does not and that verdict is recorded with its evidence. The failure mode this phase exists to prevent is the Snyk one: a scan that reads as assurance while analysing nothing.

**Depends on**: Nothing hard. The v0.8.0 milestone audit (`.planning/v0.8.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`) names this as the milestone's one genuinely open item. Three soft couplings run backwards: **Phase 9/12** built `SECURITY-EXCEPTIONS.md` and `scripts/check-advisory-register.sh`, the governance shape any new scanner's findings must fit; **Phase 15.1** applied the three GitHub rulesets and wrote `scripts/check-workflow-triggers.sh`, whose `CLAUSE_CONTEXT` and reachability clauses constrain how a new required check may be added; and **Phase 16** removed the last `SNYK_TOKEN` references, so this phase starts from a clean documentation state rather than correcting one.

**Requirements**: SAST-01, SAST-02, SAST-03, SAST-04

  **New prefix, minted 2026-08-24 per *Roadmap Extension Protocol* item 3.** Nineteen prefixes are
  now spent (`RECON-*`, `GAP-*`, `QUAL-*`, `REL-*`, `VERIFY-*`, `CLOSE-*`, `ARCH-*`, `DEBT-*`,
  `SEC-*`, `HARD-*`, `FACADE-*`, `SUPPLY-*`, `ORCH-*`, `WEB-*`, `PIPE-*`, `DEFER-*`, `DOCS-*`,
  `PROV-*`, `SAST-*`). These IDs are minted **now, at roadmap time**, deliberately: Phase 15.1
  carried `Requirements: TBD` into execution and had to settle the question retroactively, which
  the v0.8.0 audit then had to record as a traceability silence (TRACE-01). This phase does not
  repeat that.

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

  1. **The scanner is proven against a deliberate-vulnerability probe before it is adopted, not after.** A Rust fixture carrying a hardcoded credential, command injection via `sh -c`, path traversal and SQL injection is scanned, and the finding count is recorded. This is the same probe methodology that disqualified Snyk (`.github/instructions/security.instructions.md`: 0 findings in Rust against 3 for the identical JavaScript, proving the scanner ran and the Rust analysis did not). **A zero-finding result is a valid and publishable outcome of this phase** — it disqualifies the tool and the manual review stays the control. Adoption without this probe is out of bounds.

  2. **If a scanner qualifies, it runs on every pull request and cannot be path-filtered into silence.** Its workflow triggers on `pull_request` with no path filter, plus `push` on `main` and a schedule. This is not stylistic: `scripts/check-workflow-triggers.sh`'s reachability clause exists because a pinned context in a path-filtered workflow never reports, leaving the PR unmergeable forever with no failing check to point at.

  3. **It runs non-blocking first, and the observation window produces numbers.** Before the scan can gate any merge, a recorded window measures its false-positive rate and its wall-clock cost against this tree's real size (385 `.rs` files, ~142k lines). A scanner is pinned as a required check on the strength of measured behaviour, never on the strength of its vendor's claims.

  4. **Promotion to a required check updates every place the check-set is written down, in one change.** The context is added to `.github/rulesets/protect-main-branch.json` (44 → 45), the live ruleset `20868126` is re-applied, `docs/src/appendix/branch-protection.md`'s context table is updated to match, and `scripts/check-workflow-triggers.sh` passes. A required-check set that disagrees with itself across those four places is the defect this criterion forbids.

  5. **`security.instructions.md`'s "Known gap: no Rust SAST" section is rewritten to match the outcome**, stating plainly what the adopted tool does and does not cover and what the manual credential-handling review still owns. The section is narrowed or replaced by evidence — never deleted to imply coverage the phase did not establish.

  6. **Nothing in this phase makes a green result mean less than it says.** If the scan is advisory, it is described as advisory. If it gates, it gates. No `continue-on-error` step is left reporting success on a job that did not run, and no documentation claims automated coverage the probe in criterion 1 did not demonstrate.

**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 18-01-PLAN.md — Tracer: wire CodeQL end-to-end (workflow + trigger-policy row in one commit), the analysed-file evidence script, and the evidence document with its promotion threshold written before any measurement
- [ ] 18-02-PLAN.md — The workspace-excluded probe fixture: four planted defect classes in the recorded order, a fifth behind a non-default cargo feature, and the probe/steady-state scan split
- [ ] 18-03-PLAN.md — Run the probe, record the per-class result beside the coverage evidence, and settle the SAST-01 verdict
- [ ] 18-04-PLAN.md — Governed alert-dismissal register plus its offline guard, regression harness and required-check wiring
- [ ] 18-05-PLAN.md — Observation window: historical backfill via disposable push branches, live advisory period, and the full metric block
- [ ] 18-06-PLAN.md — Correct the ruleset re-application procedure, then promote across all four recorded places or record the hold with its trigger condition
- [ ] 18-07-PLAN.md — SAST-04 close: rewrite the Rust-SAST section to the measured outcome and propagate the verdict everywhere it is asserted

## Not In This Roadmap

Deliberate omissions, so a later reader does not mistake them for oversights.

### Shipped work — the large majority of the corpus

- **Shipped Milestone-1 work.** 98% of the milestone's task items are done. The per-requirement
  record is the *Milestone 1 as-shipped ledger* in `REQUIREMENTS.md`; re-planning it as phases
  would be fiction.

- **Shipped Milestone 2-3 work — which is nearly all of it.** Sanctum and RAG (Epics 11-12),
  Sentinel vision (Epics 13, 20), autonomous planning and handoffs (Epics 14, 21), Conclave
  (Epic 15), Council and Grove (Epic 16), the Maneuver Flow DSL (Epic 17), the CLI consolidation
  and enhancement (Epics 17.5, 18), Herald consolidation (Epic 19), the Paladin registry and
  Commander metadata export (Epic 22), the scheduler port and CLI configuration wiring (Epic 23)
  and the test/benchmark hardening (Epic 24) all have shipped artefacts in the tree. Phase 5
  verifies the record; it does not rebuild the features.

- **Shipped Milestone 4-6 work — which is all of it except five defects.** The Cargo workspace and
  every crate extraction, the feature-flag matrix and CLI feature gate, and all four Milestone 6
  relocations are **verified shipped against the tree**, not merely claimed.

- **Shipped Milestone 7-8 work — which is all of it bar six verified items.** The four crate
  extractions behind the cost-benefit gate, the `Dockerfile.chef` workspace adaptation, the ten
  per-crate Makefile targets, the five-benchmark migration, the whole `v0.1.0-rc.1` release cycle,
  the 25 List A deletions, `src/core/` reduced to exactly six files, the `use_cases` → `services`
  rename, the actix removal and cargo-deny ban, the three mounted axum delivery routes, and the
  reconciliation's fifteen commits (~10,250 net LOC removed).

- **Shipped Milestone 9-12 work — which is all of it bar the record and four defects.** The whole
  Milestone 9 orchestrator subsystem (`execute_workflow()` at
  `src/application/services/orchestration/mod.rs:382`, the `WorkflowRepository` port and its SQLite
  adapter, the content processors, the orchestrator bridge, `AuthPort` and RBAC); the whole
  Milestone 10 tooling set (pre-commit with a CI gate, cargo-audit reading `audit.toml`, cargo-deny,
  OSV-Scanner with SARIF, a CycloneDX SBOM in the release pipeline, `release.toml` with
  tag-triggered publishing, the `verify-tag-source` guard and committed GitHub rulesets); the mdbook
  with `warning-policy = "error"`, mdbook-mermaid, the full chapter hierarchy and all six
  deployment-topology pages; and the whole Milestone 12 web API (agent registry and controller,
  `paladin-server`, SSE streaming, in-process jobs, the unified error envelope, health/ready,
  request logging, CORS/body-limit/timeout layers, tower-governor rate limiting, API-key and bearer
  auth with per-agent roles, OpenAPI with a committed drift baseline, `Dockerfile.server`,
  `docker-compose.yml` and `k8s/`). **37 rows verified directly against the tree.** Phase 13 records
  them; no phase rebuilds them.

### Signals that are not work

- **Open checkbox counts as a backlog.** 542 items are unchecked across 75 task lists. Five runs of
  verification found them wrong in *both* directions — understating shipped reality (Conclave 129
  and Sanctum 111, both shipped), overstating completion (CLI isolation fully checked with three
  dependencies still unconditional), contradicted outright (Milestone 8's three), vacuous
  (Milestone 12's three are feature-branch scaffolding) and nonexistent (project-management's one is
  a formatting example inside a template). **Exactly one block survives: Milestone 11's 26**, and
  DOCS-01 owns it.

- **Milestone 5's, Milestone 6's, Milestone 9's and Milestone 10's checkbox counts** — all
  corroborated or contradicted by code, none converted into tasks.

- **`REQ-master-plan-epics-11-18` as new scope.** It is the origin document for Epics 11-18, dated
  2026-01-29; every one of those epics was ingested in run 2 and most are verified shipped. Its
  value is provenance — the dependency graph and the epic-level risk assessment — not scope.

### Relocations, not gaps

- **`STABLE_API.md`, `docs/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`, `docs/MIGRATION.md`, `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`,
  `docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/VERSIONING_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/BUILD_BASELINES.md`, `docs/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`.** Absent from the paths their PRDs name,
  but shipping as mdbook chapters after the Milestone 11 overhaul — which `docs/MIGRATION_LOG.md`
  records. Recording the relocation is ARCH-05 and HARD-01; building them would be duplicate work.

- **Four stale module and document paths in run-5 requirements** — `listener_service.rs`,
  `src/application/ports/output/llm_port.rs`, `docs/Design/Design_and_Architecture.md` and the
  README demos clause. Corrected at source by ORCH-03, not rebuilt.

### Positions that would break things if implemented as written

- **The 14 requirements that shipped code superseded by outcome** (HARD-01) — actix-web as a
  `paladin-web` dependency, the `storage-sqlite` flag, the per-crate ordered publish dry run, the
  `ml` feature gate, the Milestone 8 Epic 3 no-extraction mandate, the 160-file facade target (the
  tree reads 136), and the root-path documentation deliverables.

- **A `paladin-cli` crate, MCP transport feature flags, and `vision` gating the encryption
  crates.** The last would break `cargo build --no-default-features`, because `chacha20poly1305`
  and `zeroize` serve user auth and Citadel encryption, not vision.

- **A migration between the two shipped vision surfaces.** Both ship;
  `intel/code-verification.md` records this as coexistence and says to confirm intent first.

### Explicit non-goals from the source milestones

- **Hot-reloading `config.yml`**, **terminating TLS in `paladin-server`**, **fine-grained scopes
  beyond `allowed_roles` plus the admin gate**, and **encrypting configuration at rest** — all
  Milestone 12 non-goals, recorded so they are not mistaken for omissions.

- **Rewriting the 35 mdbook appendix files** — Milestone 11 Epic 3 non-goal. One exception is under
  decision: `design-and-architecture.md`, whose relocation into that exempt chapter is precisely
  why its gap survived (DOCS-02).

- **Benchmark regression detection (`critcmp`, `github-action-benchmark`)** — Deferred-QA Epic 25
  non-goal. Note the inversion: it already ships as `benchmark-regression-signal` from Milestone 7
  Epic 3, while the `bench-check` compile prerequisite does not (PIPE-01).

- **Building `paladin-arsenal`, `paladin-sanctum` or `paladin-ml`.** None exists. The first two are
  named only by a superseded disposition record that contradicts its own governing PRD (FACADE-04);
  the third is a *placement condition* on reintroducing a removed feature (FACADE-03), not a
  deliverable.

- **A future content-delivery crate.** Reserved by Milestone 7 Epic 1 as the "correct long-term
  home" for `file_content_repository.rs`; the file was then deleted and no later document mentions
  the crate. Carried as a v2 note, not a phase.

### Decisions this roadmap records but does not take

- **Resolving the 30 competing variant groups / 69 warnings.** Recording answers is in scope
  (RECON-02 … RECON-07, VERIFY-03 … VERIFY-06, ARCH-03, ARCH-04, SEC-01, SEC-02, HARD-01 … HARD-07,
  WEB-01, PIPE-02). Picking winners inside `REQUIREMENTS.md` is not — the user has stated that
  variants are expected and that settling past disagreements is not the goal of this ingest. Where
  shipped code settles a variant, that is recorded as a **fact about the tree**, at the top of the
  precedence order, not as a decision taken here. **Group 29 is the one variant shipped code cannot
  settle**: the tree carries the Milestone 12 shape and the Milestone 9 mechanism simultaneously.

- **Promoting the eleven ADR candidates.** **Zero locked decisions exist across all 263 corpus
  documents** — no ADR-typed and no SPEC-typed document exists anywhere. Promotion requires
  re-tagging the source via `--manifest` and re-running ingest; manufacturing a lock inside a
  planning artefact would fabricate authority the corpus does not contain. SEC-01 and SUPPLY-03
  record the recommendation for the two candidates with a live operational cost — the same subject,
  from two different milestones — and do not act on it.

### Tech debt tracked as v2

- **Decomposing the three oversized service files** (2,757 / 2,294 / 1,840 lines) — real debt, no
  ingested requirement demands it.

- **Clone/lock-contention work** — the 383 `.clone()` calls and nine orchestrator locks flagged in
  `codebase/CONCERNS.md`. Blocked on Phase 3 producing benchmark evidence first.

- **The `paladin-core` / `paladin-ports` dependency allowlists** — declared 6 and 7, shipping 14 and
  10. The architectural invariant holds; this is document-versus-code drift needing ARCH-03(b) to
  choose a direction.

## Roadmap Extension Protocol

**The ingest is complete.** Five runs covered all 263 documents in `.project/` — 199 classified
(188 prose + 11 task lists) and 64 `tasks-*.md` measured deterministically. **There is no run 6.**
This section is retained because the rules below still govern any *future* addition to this
roadmap, from any source.

This roadmap is **appended to**, not restructured.

1. **Do not renumber or rewrite Phases 1-16.** Phases 1-4 are Milestone 1 close-out; 5-6 are
   Milestone 2-3; 7-8 are Milestone 4-6; 9-11 are Milestone 7-8; 12-16 are Milestone 9-12 +
   Deferred-QA. New phases start at **Phase 17** and continue upward. Use decimal insertions (e.g.
   2.1) only for urgent work that must execute *between* existing integer phases.

2. **Keep the milestone-grouped form.** Add a row to the `## Milestones` table, a labelled block
   under `## Phases`, and a new expanded `## Phase Details` section for the incoming phases. Wrap
   **only genuinely completed or superseded** milestone sections in a `<details>` block labelled
   with their milestone and status. Keep the `### Phase N: Name` header format verbatim.
   **`<details>` is a scope signal, not a rendering choice: GSD's roadmap parser strips every
   `<details>` block before phase lookup** (`stripShippedMilestones` →
   `markdown-sectionizer.stripTaggedBlocks`), so any phase wrapped in one is invisible to
   `roadmap.get-phase`, `roadmap.analyze`, and every workflow built on them — `/gsd-plan-phase`
   included. Use a plain bold label line for milestones that are not started or in progress.

3. **Add new requirement ID prefixes; do not recycle. Seventeen are spent**: `RECON-*`, `GAP-*`,
   `QUAL-*`, `REL-*` (Milestone 1); `VERIFY-*`, `CLOSE-*` (Milestone 2-3); `ARCH-*`, `DEBT-*`
   (Milestone 4-6); `SEC-*`, `HARD-*`, `FACADE-*` (Milestone 7-8); `SUPPLY-*`, `ORCH-*`, `WEB-*`,
   `PIPE-*`, `DEFER-*`, `DOCS-*` (Milestone 9-12 + Deferred-QA). Ingested `REQ-*` IDs are stable
   merge keys — match on them rather than re-deriving. **Extending an existing requirement in place
   is preferred to creating a near-duplicate**: run 4 extended ARCH-01, DEBT-01 and DEBT-03; run 5
   extended DEBT-01 again (six stale references became nine) and *corrected* SEC-01. Record the
   extension at the requirement and in the footer.

4. **Expect supersession, and record the chain.** **Zero locked decisions exist across the whole
   corpus** (0 ADR, 0 SPEC across 199 classified documents), and later milestones deliberately
   restructure earlier ones. Run 2 produced eight documented supersessions of run-1 requirements;
   run 3 produced eleven more, including the entire monolith → workspace path migration and one
   requirement a later milestone reversed outright; run 4 produced eleven more still — and the first
   case of a **document superseding another document by name**,
   `facade-cleanup-RECONCILIATION-2026-06-04.md`; run 5 produced twelve more, including the first
   case of a later run **correcting an earlier run's direct code verification**. See *Superseded but
   preserved* in `REQUIREMENTS.md`. **Relocation is not contradiction.** An ADR arriving later
   outranks anything asserted in these phases; record the supersession in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions
   rather than silently editing a phase.

5. **Re-check the ledgers, not the phases.** If a later document claims earlier work is incomplete,
   verify against shipped code and update the relevant as-shipped ledger in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
   Precedence for this project is **shipped tree > `.planning/codebase/` map >
   `intel/code-verification.md` > PRD > DOC > task-list checkbox.**

6. **Checkbox counts cut both ways — verify each one.** The five-run record is conclusive: counts
   understated shipped reality (runs 1-2), were accurate once and overstated once (run 3), were
   contradicted outright (run 4), and were vacuous or nonexistent (run 5). **Never convert a count
   into a requirement without checking the tree.** The trustworthy remaining-work signal in this
   corpus is the **three deferred registers** — Milestone 8's `deferred-items.md` and
   `deferred-features.md` (whose every verifiable claim matches the tree exactly, including a
   `println!` residue count exact to the occurrence), and `Deferred-QA-CICD-Completion` with
   `DEFERRED_COVERAGE.md` (whose *scope* is real and largely unbuilt, but whose *paths and numbers*
   need re-measurement) — plus the verified defects in `intel/code-verification.md`.

7. **Path claims in old PRDs are historical, including some of the newest ones.** Every
   `src/core|application|infrastructure` path in the run-1 and run-2 corpus predates the workspace
   decomposition; several run-3 paths were moved again by Milestone 6 or 8; and **four run-5
   requirements — written in June 2026 — name paths that were already gone**. Resolve current
   locations through `.planning/codebase/` or the tree, never through a PRD.

8. **Milestone numbers in source documents are not always milestone numbers.** Four instances
   exist: the M4-M6 overviews number themselves by refactoring tier, the M3 release notes assign
   Epics 19-23 to four M2 features, PRDs cross-reference "Milestone 1 / Epic 2" meaning M4 Epic 2,
   and the M7 overview titles itself "Milestone 4". In all cases the directory / task-list numbering
   is authoritative here. **A fifth was predicted in run 5 and did not occur** (ORCH-05).

9. **The Milestones 8-11 dependency graph is spent.** It described M8 → M9 **HARD**, M8 → M11
   **HARD** on path stability with M11 Epics 3-4 waiting on M9 Epics 1-3, M9 → M11 **HARD** on API
   stability, and M8 → M10 **SOFT**; critical path M8 → M9 → M11 Epics 3-5 = 11-17 sprints, M10
   entirely off it. **Run 5 confirms every dependency was honoured and every release gate was cut**
   — v0.3.0, v0.4.0, v0.5.0, v0.6.0. Keep its dependency semantics and release-gate criteria as a
   pattern; the schedule is history.

*Roadmap created: 2026-07-30 (ingest run 1 of 5 — `.project/Milestone_1-MVP`, 36 docs)*

*Extended: 2026-07-30 (ingest run 2 of 5 — `.project/Milestone_2-Missing_features` +
`.project/Milestone_3-Completion`, 45 docs; Phases 5-6 added, Phases 1-4 unchanged)*

*Extended: 2026-07-30 (ingest run 3 of 5 — `.project/Milestone_4-Refactor-Crates-Features` +
`.project/Milestone_5-Workspace-Decomposition` + `.project/Milestone_6-Architectural-Refinements`,
32 docs; Phases 7-8 added, Phases 1-6 unchanged. Three earlier requirements were **narrowed** by
shipped-code verification rather than renumbered — RECON-02, RECON-03 and GAP-07 — and REL-02
gained the exact edition state.)*

*Extended: 2026-07-30 (ingest run 4 of 5 — `.project/Milestone_7-Production-Hardening` +
`.project/Milestone_8-Facade-Cleanup-Shim-Resolution`, 40 docs; **Phases 9-11 added, Phases 1-8
unchanged and unrenumbered.** 16 new requirements: SEC-01 … SEC-05, HARD-01 … HARD-07,
FACADE-01 … FACADE-04. ARCH-01, DEBT-01 and DEBT-03 were **extended in place** rather than
duplicated. The Milestone 4-6 detail section was wrapped in a `<details>` block per protocol
item 2; the `### Phase N:` headers are unchanged.)*

*Extended: 2026-07-30 — **INGEST RUN 5 OF 5, FINAL. THE INGEST IS COMPLETE.**
`.project/Milestone_9-Classic-Orchestrator-Completion` +
`.project/Milestone_10-CI-Hardening-Release-Automation` +
`.project/Milestone_11-Documentation-Overhaul-Publish` + `.project/Milestone_12-Web-API` +
`.project/Deferred-QA-CICD-Completion` + `.project/project-management`, 46 docs.
**Phases 12-16 added; Phases 1-11 unchanged and unrenumbered.** 24 new requirements:
SUPPLY-01 … SUPPLY-03, ORCH-01 … ORCH-05, WEB-01 … WEB-04, PIPE-01 … PIPE-05, DEFER-01 … DEFER-03,
DOCS-01 … DOCS-04. DEBT-01 was **extended in place** a second time (six stale references became
nine) and shed its four `actions-rs` references to PIPE-04; SEC-01 was **corrected in place** —
run 4's `deny.toml`-out-of-sync finding is withdrawn, and SUPPLY-01/SUPPLY-02 carry the corrected
scope. The Milestone 7-8 detail section was wrapped in a `<details>` block per protocol item 2, and
the Overview was rewritten so this file reads as one roadmap rather than five appended fragments;
every `### Phase N:` header is unchanged and verbatim.
**Cumulative: 263 documents covered, 554 requirements, 86 forward requirements across 16 phases,
60 variant entries across 30 groups, 69 warnings, 0 blockers, 0 locked decisions, 11 ADR
candidates.***

*Corrected: 2026-07-30 (structural defect, no scope change). Runs 3, 4 and 5 wrapped the
**not-started** Milestone 1, 2-3, 4-6 and 7-8 detail sections in `<details>` blocks, citing
protocol item 2 — but item 2 reserves that wrapper for **completed or superseded** milestones, and
its claim that "downstream tooling parses it, including inside `<details>`" was false. GSD's
roadmap parser strips every `<details>` block before phase lookup, so **Phases 1-11 were invisible
to `roadmap.get-phase` and every workflow built on it**; `/gsd-plan-phase 1` failed with
`malformed_roadmap`. The four wrappers were replaced with plain bold label lines matching the
Milestone 9-12 form already used in this file, and protocol item 2 was corrected to state the
parser contract. **No phase, requirement, goal, success criterion or `### Phase N:` header was
changed** — only the four `<details>`/`<summary>`/`</details>` wrapper lines were removed. All 16
phases now resolve.*

*Extended: 2026-08-15 — **first forward addition, not ingest-derived.** Phase 17 (Additional LLM
Provider Adapters) added under a new **Provider Expansion** milestone label, per *Roadmap Extension
Protocol* item 1 ("New phases start at Phase 17 and continue upward"). Phases 1-16 unchanged and
unrenumbered; every `### Phase N:` header is verbatim. One new requirement prefix — **`PROV-*`**
(PROV-01 … PROV-04) — the eighteenth, recycling none of the seventeen spent. The phase leads with a
**provider-selection study** rather than a build list: which candidates qualify is itself the first
deliverable, and PROV-02's size is set by PROV-01's verdicts.*
