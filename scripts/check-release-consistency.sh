# check-release-consistency.sh
#
# The pre-publish consistency gate (PUBOPS-01). Verifies that a release
# tag's version string exactly matches the manifest version of every
# publishable Cargo workspace package, before `publish-crates` is allowed to
# run. PUBOPS-01's binding claim is "no crate is published until the tag,
# every manifest version and every changelog agree" -- this script is the
# single source of truth both the release.yml gate job and the local `make
# check-release-consistency` target invoke; no gate logic is duplicated in
# workflow YAML.
#
# This script is offline when --metadata-json is supplied, and otherwise
# makes exactly one local `cargo metadata` call -- it never talks to the
# network. It accumulates every mismatch into one report rather than
# stopping at the first, so a release with three broken crates gets one
# report naming all three, never a fix-one-rerun-find-the-next loop. It only
# reads: given the same tag and the same metadata, running it twice produces
# byte-identical output and the same exit code.
#
# Clauses implemented so far (D-08 clauses 1-3 of 4; SHA agreement is
# future scope):
#
#   1. Manifest agreement. Every publishable package in the Cargo workspace
#      -- discovered via `cargo metadata --no-deps --format-version 1`,
#      never a hardcoded list -- has a `version` field that is exactly equal
#      (string equality, no semver normalisation or coercion) to the tag's
#      version with at most one leading `v` stripped. `0.8.1` and
#      `0.8.1-rc.2` are different strings and therefore a mismatch. A
#      package is publishable when its manifest's `publish` field is absent
#      (`cargo metadata` reports this as JSON `null`); a package carrying
#      `publish = false` (`cargo metadata` reports this as an empty list)
#      is excluded by design, never counted as a mismatch.
#
#   2. Changelog-section agreement. Every publishable package's own
#      changelog -- `CHANGELOG.md` in the directory containing that
#      package's `manifest_path`, never a hardcoded `crates/*/CHANGELOG.md`
#      glob (the root package's manifest sits at the workspace root, so its
#      changelog is the root `CHANGELOG.md`; every crate resolves to its own
#      file) -- carries a heading matching `## [<exact tag version>]`,
#      optionally followed by a dated suffix (`## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-01`
#      satisfies `--tag v1.2.3`; `## [1.2.3-rc.1]` and `## [1.2.30]` do not,
#      because the match is on the bracketed content exactly, never a
#      prefix). A changelog file that is entirely absent and one that exists
#      but carries no section for this version are two distinct failure
#      messages, never conflated into one.
#
#   3. CI-conclusion agreement (PUBOPS-02, D-10). The tagged commit (--sha)
#      must have a recorded, successful `ci.yml` run. `--ci-runs-json`, when
#      supplied, is read instead of calling the API -- the same fixture seam
#      pattern as --metadata-json, and the parsing code path is identical to
#      what a live `gh api` response takes. Otherwise this script calls
#      `gh api repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/workflows/ci.yml/runs`
#      with `head_sha=<sha>` and `status=completed`, paginated. Assumption
#      A2 (that endpoint accepts the workflow filename in the path) is
#      *removed*, not assumed: a clean 404 triggers a fallback that resolves
#      `ci.yml`'s numeric workflow id from
#      `repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/actions/workflows` (matching `path`
#      ending in `/ci.yml`) and retries against that id. Any other lookup
#      failure -- transport, authorisation, rate limiting -- is
#      CI_LOOKUP_FAILED, a non-zero exit distinct from "no successful run
#      exists"; it is never silently treated as a pass. The deciding run is
#      selected by sorting the returned array by `created_at` ascending with
#      `id` as the tiebreak, then taking the last element -- never indexing
#      the array unsorted, so two runs sharing a timestamp still resolve
#      deterministically to the higher id, and an older success followed by
#      a newer failure on the same SHA fails the clause.
#
#      Granularity: the whole-run conclusion, not a named job subset. This
#      is re-derived from `ci.yml` each time this comment is read, not
#      carried on trust: on a push to `main` (the only event that produces
#      the run this clause reads), the single job carrying a job-level
#      `continue-on-error` is `benchmark-regression-signal`, whose `if:`
#      restricts it to `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch` -- it does not
#      run at all on the push this clause inspects. `osv-scanner`'s
#      tolerance is step-level (`continue-on-error: true` on individual
#      steps), so the job itself still gates. Every other job in `ci.yml` is
#      hard-gating. There is therefore no job that is simultaneously
#      known-flaky, release-irrelevant, and able to turn the run red -- the
#      condition that would make whole-run granularity unusably strict. The
#      `release.yml` Build Binaries flakiness recorded in Phase 19's
#      evidence lives in a different workflow and does not bear on this
#      run's conclusion. If a non-blocking job is ever added to `ci.yml`
#      that can fail the run, this clause must be revisited rather than
#      loosened ad hoc.
#
#      MISSING_SHA: when `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` and no `--sha` was supplied,
#      the whole gate fails closed with this token before any clause runs --
#      the CI-conclusion clause can never be silently absent on the CI path.
#      Outside GitHub Actions, an absent `--sha` still runs clauses 1-2 and
#      states explicitly in the report that clause 3 was not checked, so a
#      local pass is never misread as a full-gate pass.
#
#      No `-L`/`--location` (or any other redirect-following option) is
#      ever passed to `curl` or `gh` here, per the credential-header control
#      in `security.instructions.md`.
#
# Discovering zero publishable packages is a named ZERO_PACKAGES failure
# with a non-zero exit -- a broken enumeration must never present as a pass
# over an empty set, matching the convention `check-changelogs.sh` and
# `check-workflow-triggers.sh` already establish for this repo's gate
# scripts.
#
# Sourcing seam: set CHECK_RELEASE_CONSISTENCY_LIB_ONLY=1 before sourcing
# this file to load the check_release_consistency_main function without
# executing it -- this file's own regression harness (and later plans'
# harnesses) use this to exercise the function directly.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/check-release-consistency.sh --tag <vX.Y.Z|X.Y.Z>
#             [--metadata-json <path>] [--workspace-root <path>]
#             [--sha <sha>] [--ci-runs-json <path>]
#         --tag is required. --metadata-json, when supplied, is read
#         instead of invoking `cargo metadata` -- the fixture seam this
#         script's regression test uses so it never invokes cargo.
#         --workspace-root overrides the repo root `cargo metadata` is run
#         from (default: derived from BASH_SOURCE); it has no effect when
#         --metadata-json is supplied. --sha names the commit clause 3
#         checks; the caller supplies it (release.yml's `--sha` wiring is
#         plan 20-05's `release.yml` pass). --ci-runs-json, when supplied,
#         is read instead of calling `gh api` -- the fixture seam this
#         script's regression test uses so it never touches the network.
#         An unrecognised flag is a usage error.
# Exit:   0 if every publishable package's manifest version exactly equals
#         the tag version, every publishable package's own changelog
#         carries a section for it, AND (when checked) the tagged SHA's most
#         recent completed ci.yml run concluded success (status OK);
#         non-zero for MISMATCH, CHANGELOG_MISMATCH, CI_MISMATCH, any
#         combination of those three joined with `_AND_`, CI_LOOKUP_FAILED,
#         ZERO_PACKAGES, MISSING_TAG, MISSING_SHA, or a usage error
#         (unknown flag / missing python3).
