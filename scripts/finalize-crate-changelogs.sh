# Stamps a dated "## [X.Y.Z]" section into the changelog of every publishable
# Cargo workspace package -- including the root package's CHANGELOG.md --
# for the version being released (D-09). This is what makes the strict,
# no-exemptions check-release-consistency.sh gate satisfiable in one
# invocation instead of an eleven-file manual chore: today all ten crate
# changelogs sit at "## [Unreleased]" with no versioned section, which the
# gate correctly refuses.
#
# Per RESEARCH.md Pitfall 5 and release.toml's own comment: cargo-release's
# `pre-release-replacements` is package-scoped, not workspace-scoped, so a
# root-level replacement would run once per crate and duplicate the heading
# -- this script is the carrier instead, extending the same
# perl-substitution idea `make release` already applied to the root
# CHANGELOG.md into a loop over every publishable package's own changelog.
#
# Enumeration: publishable packages come from `cargo metadata --no-deps
# --format-version 1` (never a hardcoded list or a crates/* glob) -- the
# same enumeration scripts/check-release-consistency.sh uses, so the two
# scripts can never disagree about which files matter. A package's
# changelog is resolved as CHANGELOG.md in the directory holding its
# manifest_path, which is what makes the root package resolve to the root
# CHANGELOG.md and each crate to its own crates/<name>/CHANGELOG.md,
# without any special-casing of the root package.
#
# Per-file disposition, in this order:
#   1. If a section for the target version already exists (a line beginning
#      with the literal "## [X.Y.Z]" prefix, regardless of any trailing
#      " - date" text), the file is left untouched and recorded
#      already-finalized. This is what makes a second run of the identical
#      invocation a no-op: byte-identical output, exit 0.
#   2. Else, if the "## [Unreleased]" anchor heading exists, the new dated
#      section is inserted immediately after it (preserving the anchor), so
#      the file stays in reverse-chronological order with the newest
#      release first even when an older versioned section already exists
#      below the anchor. Recorded finalized.
#   3. Else (no anchor, and no existing section for this version), the file
#      is left untouched and the package is recorded as a named failure.
#      This script never guesses a target line to append at.
#
# Every package is processed even if an earlier one failed -- failures are
# accumulated and reported together at the end (collect-then-report), never
# fail-fast. Discovering zero publishable packages is itself a named
# ZERO_PACKAGES failure, never a report of success over an empty set,
# matching the convention check-release-consistency.sh and
# check-changelogs.sh already establish for this repo's gate/tooling
# scripts.
#
# Sourcing seam: set FINALIZE_CRATE_CHANGELOGS_LIB_ONLY=1 before sourcing
# this file to load the finalize_crate_changelogs_main function without
# executing it.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/finalize-crate-changelogs.sh --version <X.Y.Z>
#             [--date <YYYY-MM-DD>] [--metadata-json <path>]
#             [--workspace-root <path>]
#         --version is required (no leading "v" -- pass the bare semver
#         string, e.g. 0.9.0 or 0.9.0-rc.1; this script does not strip a
#         leading "v" the way check-release-consistency.sh's --tag does,
#         since callers pass $(VERSION) directly, never a tag ref).
#         --date defaults to today (YYYY-MM-DD, UTC-naive `date +%Y-%m-%d`).
#         --metadata-json, when supplied, is read instead of invoking
#         `cargo metadata` -- the fixture seam this script's regression
#         test uses so it never invokes cargo and never touches the real
#         tree (every fixture's manifest_path resolves into a scratch
#         directory, not crates/ or the repo root).
#         --workspace-root overrides the repo root `cargo metadata` is run
#         from (default: derived from BASH_SOURCE); it has no effect when
#         --metadata-json is supplied. An unrecognised flag is a usage
#         error.
# Exit:   0 if every publishable package's changelog carries (or already
#         carried) a section for the target version (status OK); non-zero
#         for FINALIZE_FAILED (one or more packages could not be
#         finalized), ZERO_PACKAGES, MISSING_VERSION, or a usage error
#         (unknown flag / missing python3).
